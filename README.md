# elmo-morphosyntactic-analysis
As a submission to Sigmorphon 2019 Task 2, we developed a machine learning model for predicting POS tags, Unimorph tags, and Lemma forms. We did this using elmo contextual word embeddings trained only on the bible in each language. We use the bible alignment to achieve cross-lingual transfer of vectors in a translation matrix.
